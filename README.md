# Personal Website - haltaf000.github.io
This is my personnal website I created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript/Bootstrap. I've created this website over a year ago to showcase my web development and design skills. 
Although I could have taken the easier route and built a website using some fancy software available online, I decided to experiment and go through the process of development myself. 

#HTML5
The first task was to set up the layout for the webpage. I drew by hand what I wanted my website to be like and then went on to code. My goal was to create four seperate pages where I showcase
writing, coding, and photography skills. All of these sub-pages are linked on the navigation tab, along with an Contact option that opens up an email linking to my contact information. 

#CSS5
I used basic layout to design and implement color, boxes, and typography. Somewhere along the project, I started to learn about bootstrap and its implementation that led me to integrate it to my
website. I also uploaded all of the images on a CSS page, referencing them to their proper webpage. 

#Javascript
I used basic script methods to make it a bit interactive. 

#Still a work in process...
I am continuesouly working on my projects, or all sorts and not just coding. Therefore, at the moment, everything is pretty much empty. I do hope to post all the materials by July. 
IF any of you have any suggestions please let me know.
