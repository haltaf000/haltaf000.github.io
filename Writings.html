         I write about the challenges of learning data science, why it is vital in history, and how we can help improve the world through this very important subject. I was first introduced to data analyst through studying History. Yes, History. Well, not exactly. It was in the library of Stanford University, where I came across certain data types used by colonial forces throughout the British Empire. This arose my curiosity about how data was determining the decisions and policies of British and revolutionary leaders in the colonies. Ah, many questions and problems but not a lot of solutions. After going through many documents filled with data, I've decided to finally embrace technology and see how I can use it to study the past. I've asked my Computer Science friends for help to utilize large data sets. They said "Why do you need us? You can go on and study the subject on your own. We have bigger fish to fry!" Dismayed, but not discouraged. I went towards the C.S. department and asked, politely, of course, to help me learn Data Science for my history project. Depending on their facial expressions, they all seemed puzzled at first. Why would he need, from all the people on earth, need data tools for his humanities project? Well, humanities aren't all about writing and reading. An important component of History is to think critically and analytical about the material we encounter and to make proper unbiased judgments of society. The technology was further going to revolutionize this idea. As I learned data manipulation tools, first with SQL and then Python, I was able to alternate data sets to ask particular questions. For the first time of my archival History, it seemed I've actually known what these people were thinking about making plans for conquering and resistance.
